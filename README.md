# Strapi for lu-ka.me

This is the repository housing the Strapi application being used by lu-ka.me

It's hosted on an AWS bucket.

It's basically a vanilla Strapi application with some minor adjustments made for the website.

## Modifications Made

- Projects & Rambles collection types
- Enable fetching Rambles via their unique slugs instead of ids

That's basically it!
